## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Vue
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

During this challenge I have been working with Vue.js to get a better hold on the basics of using reuseable components and passing data with props with Vue. 
It's been a joy and I'm really starting to enjoy the framework. 

I added TailwindCSS which is used to style the overall design layout. During this project I learned how to configure TailwindCSS whenever i need a custom utility class. 

### Continued development

Next step in this project is to add some JS functionality so the user can change slides with a press on the keyboard
